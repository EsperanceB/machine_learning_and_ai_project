# Machine Learning & AI Career Journey

Welcome to my personal documentation space—a living portfolio of my transition into Machine Learning Engineering, with a strong foundation in AWS cloud technologies and hands-on AI development.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is more than just code—it's a reflection of my commitment to mastering Machine Learning and AI. From foundational labs to self-designed projects, I chronicle my growth, experiments, and breakthroughs as I evolve into a full-fledged ML Engineer.

## What You'll Find Here

- ✅ **AWS ML Labs**: Step-by-step walkthroughs of AWS SageMaker, EC2, Lambda, and AI services  
- 🛠️ **Custom ML Projects**: End-to-end pipelines built from scratch using Python, scikit-learn, and AWS SDK  
- 📊 **Data Exploration & Visualization**: Insightful EDA using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib  
- 🧪 **Model Training & Evaluation**: Logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks with performance metrics  
- 🔐 **Security & Deployment**: Key pair management, ELB setup, and secure EC2 orchestration  
- 📚 **Learning Logs**: Reflections, challenges, and lessons learned along the way


## 🌍 Why This Matters

As I transition into Machine Learning Engineering, I believe in learning by doing—and documenting by teaching. This repo is my open notebook, where I share not just what I build, but how I think.

Whether you're a recruiter, fellow learner, or future collaborator—thank you for stopping by. Your time and curiosity mean a lot.
